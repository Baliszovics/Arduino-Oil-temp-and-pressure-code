# Arduino-Oil-temp-and-pressure-code
My first project with Arduino, an OLED display, and sensor.

You can check it in my video how it working: https://youtu.be/Wn5kIrU5_tc

This is a work in progress code but if you can figure it out you can customize for your own taste.

The sensor that I using with this program is: HELLA 6PP 010 378-101
